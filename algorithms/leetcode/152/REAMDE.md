I first did the n^2 solution just fine which is suboptimal but honestly might just be fine.

I then tried n() solution using a similar system to the easier highest sum version of this problem. But there was a logical flaw in cases where there were 3 negatives and the second combo returned a higher product [1, -2, -2, -100] => 4 not 200

Then I googled the answer :(
