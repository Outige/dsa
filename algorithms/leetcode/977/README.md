I submitted 2 solutions.

1. Negate array > sort array > square and return array
    1. Time: nlog(n)
    1. Space: O(1)

My second solution and the more optimal one was to use a left and a right pointer. Find the first positive and last negative number and do comparisons on these pointers.
Time: O(n)
Space: O(n)
