# Feedback

## Things you did well:
The way he explains the approach is clear. He is also good at thinking edge cases and trying to solve them.

## Things you should work on:
Maybe you can practice more on two-pointers/string questions. You can easily find these related questions on leetcode by the tags. Same question on leetcode but more test cases can be found here: https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-words-in-a-string/. You can try to paste your solution and see if it also passes. Good luck!! Sorry I didn't know the session will end by itself, it's really nice to meet you and thank you for your guidance and help:)
